# etch-a-sketch

ToDo:

- Refactor mouseenter events to set classes instead of background-color
- create classes for color changing (with rgba())
- removeEventListener() and remove classes on reset
- grayscale class and increase opacity by 0.1 every fired event (background-color: "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)"+(something that takes the opcaity characters of the current color)
- finish ui
